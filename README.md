Google Map and Instagram Mashup

This is an interesting mashup of google maps and instagram media search api.
This mashup uses the google map to set the location using the draging of the marker and use this LAT LNG to 
search media in this location.

This project also uses the emilsjolander's flip view to enable flip type effect while 
crawling through the media.
